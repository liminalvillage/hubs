    "text": "There is more to plants than just their chemical compounds though. Science is catching up with what indigenous people have been saying for the better part of eternity; plants are (at least) as sophisticated in behavior as animals but their potential has been masked as they work on much slower timescales than animals. Plants communicate, learn, remember and decide without brains but they are still cognizant. As they are so different from us and we communicate in different \"languages\" communication needs to be established on common ground. This might feel unfamiliar at first but its fundamental to all living organisms as we exchange information with the natural environment. This form of communication is embodied in people with a \"green thumb\" and goes much further than just buying herbal medicines from a shop; itâ€™s about cultivating an environment out in the world as well."
