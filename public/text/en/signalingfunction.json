    "text": "Painful symptoms can be interpreted as a wake-up call to help us understand where we need to focus attention. Paradoxically pain is often treated like an unwelcome guest–it might be challenging to let it sit, when all we want is to have it leave as soon as possible–but pain is one of the symptoms that our body uses to have us notice a physical or emotional threat that we have been avoiding. This threat can be imminent like a fractured bone we shouldn’t strain, but can also be more complex and less obvious. In that case we need to dig deeper and think “outside of the box” to reveal the root cause of the pain."
