    "text": "By working with a genosociogram we can start to name the forgotten ancestors and their life events so that they can be integrated into our personal story. A genosociogram is a family tree completed with major life events and their emotional context. Examples are accidental illnesses, unresolved grief, unsaid events, family myths and so on. When you draw a genosociogram, it helps to grasp the full set of these relationships and events."
