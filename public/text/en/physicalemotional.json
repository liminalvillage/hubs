    "name":"Physical and Emotional Pain",
    "text": "Chronic pain is like an intricate dance of physical and emotional pain. Numerous studies confirm the idea that negative emotions can cause physical symptoms. Although there has been a paradigm shift from a model focused on nociception to a more interactive mindâ€“body model; patients are sometimes not well informed about this connection by their physicians. Although we feel pain in the body, it is constructed entirely in the brain (\"no brain no pain\"). Obviously, this doesn't mean the pain is any less real. The brain has evolved a certain amount of overlap between its emotion and pain centers and because of this, what we feel emotionally may determine, in part, what we experience physically in our bodies. In this way the pain in our body becomes like a map that can guide us to uncover deeper emotional issues within ourselves."
