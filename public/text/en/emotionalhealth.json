    "text":"I believe our emotional state of mind plays a bigger role in preventing and curing disease than we are currently acknowledging. Unfortunately, many of us do not learn to connect with our emotions and to listen to the messages our body is sending us. In fact, we tend to ignore these cues which let us know that something is out of balanceâ€“often waiting until these subtle signals become symptoms or even severe disease. The longer we ignore our emotional needs, the unhealthier we get. The more we wait, the harder it is to fix whatever is causing the unbalance. For this reason, one of the main features of Bridge Medicine is to learn about specific tools to reconnect to our emotions trough the symptoms expressed by our body."
