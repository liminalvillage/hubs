    "name":"The Doctor",
    "text": "From a very early age I knew I wanted to care for others and help them on their healing paths. Due to the environment in which I was raised this meant becoming a medical doctor. Therefore, I went through the long, rewarding and (sometimes) painful path of medical school to specialize in anesthesiology and pain medicine. In both fields, I take care of patients on a difficult journey; at the physical level as an anesthesiologist supporting surgery, and at the mental level as a chronic pain physician when the body is signaling all kinds of unresolved experiences and emotions."
