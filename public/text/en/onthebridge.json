    "text": "As I began to investigate alternative views on chronic pain, other than what I'd been taught in medical school, I dove into an unfamiliar world for a doctor with a background in Western medicine. Learning about traditional Chinese, Indian and Shamanic medicine fundamentally challenged my perspective. The biggest insight on this transformational journey was personally experiencing the power of medicine without pills, needles and scalpels.  Serendipitously, in the most unlikely part of the world, I met a shaman from West-Africa (link to wayassimeditation.org) who introduced and initiated me into the world of healing with the goal of becoming a \"medicine woman\"."
