    "name":"Paradox of Family Secrets",
    "text": "Unconscious transgenerational transmission can occur directly through parental behavior. In our childhood, parental incongruity can create a form of cognitive dissonance – the child might perceive an oddity when words and actions don’t intuitively correspond – creating a split between what the child is consciously registering and what they sense internally. This paradox can be traumatic and lead to a feeling of unexplainable burden later in life. Because something has been secret, hidden or denied it can be challenging to heal these types of experience. In this way, we can pass on trauma, conflict, unfinished mourning and other unconscious patterns from one generation to the next."
