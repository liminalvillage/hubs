    "text":"In Western medical practice, treatment relies on the assumption that the human body is composed of separate, independent parts, as if it was an intricate machine. The heart is a pump, the eye is a camera, the brain is a computer. This view has been advantageous to study every piece scientifically and find treatments for specific parts of the body. Modern medicine has created powerful and effective pharmaceuticals and surgery for specific diseases but humans are not machines. So, we struggle to find cures for diseases that cannot be resolved from this mechanistic point of view. Symptoms are often expressions of a broader problem in the organism. Many treatments offered suppress the symptom without curing the underlying disease or imbalance within ourselves. One example is the fact that western medicine treats a variety of skin and auto-immune disease with the use of steroids. There is no doubt that steroids help suppress symptoms but it often does just that, without addressing the root cause of the problem; the same applies to treating pain purely with medication."
