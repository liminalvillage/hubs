    "text": "Another valuable tool for transgenerational integration is reenactment. To discharge the energy of past events; in many cultures there are traditional rituals and playful acts to release the negative emotions stored in the body. From a shamanic point of view, symptoms can be expressions of loyalty towards ancestors that went through the traumatic experience themselves.\nOne example of reenactment is the use of \"spirit animals\" as a way to express ancestral emotions. Through such ritual, it's believed that disease is less likely to appear in the body; it doesn’t matter if the experience is only a metaphor for the past event – the subconscious registers it as real! Theater, dance and wearing costumes (Carnival) are rituals in our Western society that are useful reenactment."
