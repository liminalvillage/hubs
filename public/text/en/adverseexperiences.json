    "text": "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are potentially traumatic events that can have negative and persistent effects on health later in life. Studies have shown that ACEs are associated with chronic diseases and pain in adulthood. One underlying mechanism involves an affected hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress response which influences cortisol patterns and the autoimmune system.  The neurological substrate linking ACEs to certain pain, mood and anxiety disorders may be a disregulation of the HPA axis and autoimmune system. Often, we develop coping mechanisms to deal with ACEs in childhood. An example of such a response is when a part of our psyche detaches itself from consciousness in order to cope with the stressful experience. We dissociate to prevent further psychological damage. When the dissociation is severe, we call it a personality disorder. But most of us – even without a diagnosed mental health disorder – suffer in a sense from \"split personality\"."
