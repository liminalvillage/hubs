    "text": "Throughout history, plants have been identified and used by humans. They are known for their ability to synthesize a wide variety of chemical compounds. Western medicine, in contrast, makes use of pharmaceuticals which act on specific parts of the body. Plants work across our bodies systemically, and act on several organs at once. The effects appear slower than pharmaceuticals but offer a longer-term solution without creating dependencies on various substances. For these reasons they are suitable as preventative medicine and for symptoms that haven't progressed to severe disease."
