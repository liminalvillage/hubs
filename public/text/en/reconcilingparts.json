    "name":"Reconciling Lost Parts",
    "text": "The biggest issue regarding these \"split personalities\" is when we over-identify with them, believing these fabricated creations define our identity. One personality (or persona) can become dominant suppressing the other parts of ourselves. As a consequence, the \"shadow sides\" of these undermined personas can emerge outside of our consciousness in the most unexpected moments. These \"shadows\" can obstruct our personal development, determination, creativity and our relationships with others. Correspondingly, pain can be an expression of a suppressed persona; reintegrating these parts of our personality and getting them to collaborate is an important part of personal harmonization â€“ we can subsequently live our lives without feeling the burden of these \"lost parts\" of ourselves."
