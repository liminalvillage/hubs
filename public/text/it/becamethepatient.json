    "text": "When I noticed that my body was resisting the long hours and hectic life in the city, I decided it was time to move to a slower pace. I moved to the countryside in Italy where half of my DNA is rooted. I mistakenly thought that in leaving my hectic life all the painful symptoms in my body and my inflamed skin would magically disappear... However, I fell into the same patterns that moved me in the city and nothing really changed. Only when I started to walk the shamanic path and dig deep into my past, my personalities and my behavior was I able to see the desired changes in myself, my health and consequently, in my environment."
