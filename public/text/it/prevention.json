    "name":"Prevention is key",
    "text":"The emphasis on prevention trough lifestyle advice has been expanding in conventional medicine and elsewhere. Everyone knows a healthy diet and exercise is beneficial for the prevention of diseases. As a consequence, there is a big emphasis on this aspect, it almost seems if you eat right and exercise, you can live long and prosper–but clearly there is more than keeping fit in order to prevent disease! A physician might toss “avoid stress” at you but it doesn’t get much more specific than that. Not because doctors don’t care about the emotional state of their patients but because they simply don’t teach us anything more in medical school. It is impossible to give tailored advice on prevention when you only get 5-10 minutes to evaluate each patient. Besides, prevention is generally focused on the collective because it is easier to study the effect of a preventative measure on large groups than on individuals."
