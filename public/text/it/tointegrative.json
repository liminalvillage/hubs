    "text":"While many patients have found the way to mind-body practices and other complementary or alternative health treatments, medical doctors are sometimes reluctant to get involved in these unfamiliar practices. To them, alternative therapies are often perceived as pseudoscience. Although some physicians focus on whether or not these therapies can be scientifically proven in placebo controlled randomized trials, others are realizing these therapies have one very important aspect in common: they take the whole patient into account while seeing the person as a symbiotic being connected to its environment. This holistic approach is often a far cry from the brisk five minutes snatched from a GP or a specialist in the hospital. Integrative medicine emphasizes a holistic, patient-focused approach to health care and wellness—often including mental, emotional, functional, spiritual, social, and community aspects—and treating the whole person rather than specific parts of the body."
