    "text": "My story starts with my DNA - my ancestors. I've often wondered where my sense of determination came from. A decisiveness that I also notice clearly in my daughterâ€™s character. My ancestors came from Germany to the Netherlands in the mid-18th century and were so poor they lived underground with twigs functioning as a roof. Their kids were born under these circumstances but records show that they were able to climb the societal ladder. I can only imagine how determined they must have been to extract themselves from their circumstances! I also wish to mention my Italian grandmother Luisa from whom I received a sense of intuition and sensitivity to the natural world - for which I'm deeply grateful."
