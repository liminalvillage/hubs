    "text": "Like the roots of a tree, we are causally linked to our ancestors. We inherit their DNA but also their life experiences, positive and negative through mechanisms described in epigenetics. We consider ourselves living in the present but chances are that we are unconsciously reenacting unresolved issues of our ancestors. Because we don’t live in a culture where we remember and honor our ancestors we become orphans of our past – if we unconsciously hold on to an ancestral loyalty, we allow it to keep us attached to unhealthy patterns. Staying bound to a particular view of who we are in this world, we can become blocked from fully expressing ourselves. Symptoms (like pain) can act as keys to unlock family patterns; only by becoming conscious of these inheritances can we start freeing ourselves from the family chains that are driving our health. We can then make clearer choices and take actions to honor the lessons of our past.\nThe process of transgenerational therapy is about learning to become neutral towards how you came into this life without judgement towards your parents so that you can use your full potential without feeling restricted. Only then will you be able to pass this potential on to future generations."
