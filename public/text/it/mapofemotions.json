    "name":"Map of Emotions",
    "text": "As mentioned previously, symptoms in the body can function as a map or a key to unlock something that has been blocking us from living an unobstructed and purposeful life. That something is generally rooted in our past experiences (see \"ACE\"); adverse situations or ”undigested memories” which unconsciously trigger us. This in turn can cause symptoms because the body stores whatever is not being expressed. Modern Western pain medicine–unlike traditional Indian and Chinese medicine–does not focus on this mechanism. Most of us have recognized the \"butterflies\" in our belly when we fancy someone and unconsciously fear rejection but we are not attuned to the countless other bodily sensations that correspond with our emotions."
