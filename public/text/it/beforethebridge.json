    "text": "IT While working as a pain management specialist in the Netherlands I witnessed how complex the evaluation and treatment of chronic pain can be; I realized that as a doctor I did not have the right tools to help all my patients. This applied mostly to patients with symptoms that were not explainable from a purely medical point of view. I grew tired of prescribing medication that I knew would not act on the root cause and would most likely only add more symptoms to the condition. Ironically, I personally developed unexplainable chronic aches during my work as a pain physician (see “my story”). I decided it was time to take a break from my work and reflect on what I wanted my professional life to look like–and most importantly–what was happening to my own body"
